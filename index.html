      <h2>What is energy efficiency and conservation ?</h2>

      <p>Energy efficiency is the practice of using technology and strategies to reduce energy consumption while maintaining or even improving performance and comfort. It involves making smart choices in how energy is used, ensuring minimal waste and maximum output. This can be applied across homes, businesses, industries, and transportation.

        Key examples of energy efficiency include:
        <br>
        1. Upgrading Technology: Using energy-efficient appliances, LED lighting, or advanced heating and cooling systems.
        
        <br>
        2. Smart Systems: Installing programmable thermostats or energy management systems to optimize energy usage.
        
        <br>
        3. Improved Design: Constructing buildings with better insulation, energy-efficient windows, or solar panels to reduce energy needs.
        
        <br>
        4. Behavioral Changes: Turning off lights when not in use, reducing water heating temperatures, or encouraging carpooling.
        <br>
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        <br>
        Energy conservation is the practice of actively reducing energy use through behavioral changes and mindful decision-making. Unlike energy efficiency, which focuses on doing the same tasks with less energy, conservation involves limiting or avoiding unnecessary energy consumption altogether. It’s about changing habits to use only what’s needed and avoiding waste.

Key examples of energy conservation include:
<br>

1. Adjusting Appliance Usage: Running dishwashers and washing machines only with full loads to minimize energy consumption.
<br>

2. Seasonal Adaptations: Wearing warmer clothing in winter and lighter clothing in summer to reduce heating and cooling needs.

<br>
3. Opting for Public Transport: Using buses, trains, or carpooling instead of driving individual vehicles to reduce energy and fuel consumption.
