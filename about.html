          <p>
            We are students at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology, and Maritime Transport
            <br>. Through our Energy Management Systems course, our goal is to create a website to educate people about energy efficiency and energy conservation, how to apply them in real life, and how we can save energy in our university.
            <br>
            The purpose of this website is to serve as an awareness platform for all students at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology, and Maritime Transport, as well as our colleagues in the Supply Chain Management Department.
            <br>
            We hope this website meets your expectations and provides valuable insights.
            <br>
            The team behind this website includes Marwan Emad, Hassan Walid, Waleed Gamal, Seif Tamer, Youssef Eissa, Mohamed Hesham, and Mohamed Ahmed.
            <br>
            We couldn’t have created this website without the valuable support and guidance of our professor, Dr. Sherif Haddara, and our dedicated teaching assistant, Ms. Sarah Hesham.
