          <h2>who are we?</h2>

          <p>
            We are students at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology, and Maritime Transport
            <br>. Through our Energy Management Systems course, our goal is to create a website to educate people about energy efficiency and energy conservation, how to apply them in real life, and how we can save energy in our university.
            <br>
            The purpose of this website is to serve as an awareness platform for all students at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology, and Maritime Transport, as well as our colleagues in the Supply Chain Management Department.
            <br>
            We hope this website meets your expectations and provides valuable insights.
            <br>
            The team behind this website includes Marwan Emad, Hassan Walid, Waleed Gamal, Seif Tamer, Youssef Eissa, Mohamed Hesham, and Mohamed Ahmed.
            <br>
            We couldn’t have created this website without the valuable support and guidance of our professor, Dr. Sherif Haddara, and our dedicated teaching assistant, Ms. Sarah Hesham.

          <h2>why did we choose the web application team</h2>
          <p><p>
            We chose to focus on creating a web application to promote energy-saving habits at our college because it offers the most engaging, accessible, and scalable solution for reaching both students and staff. Unlike other approaches, such as green energy or sensor and control systems, a web application allows us to engage a broader audience and influence behavior in a direct and meaningful way.
          </p>
          <p>
            A key advantage of a web application is its accessibility—it can be used by anyone at any time, from any device. This makes it incredibly convenient for both students and staff to engage with energy-saving practices, no matter their location or schedule. Additionally, the web application provides a platform for ongoing engagement by offering features like progress tracking, notifications, and personalized tips. These interactive elements keep users motivated and involved, ensuring that they remain committed to changing their energy habits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another important benefit is that a web application serves as an educational resource, breaking down complex energy-saving concepts into clear, actionable advice. This makes it easier for the entire college community to understand the importance of their actions and implement energy-saving strategies. By offering up-to-date tips, tutorials, and information, we can help students and staff make informed decisions about how to reduce energy consumption in their everyday lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the long-term impact of the web application is significant. Unlike one-time campaigns or physical systems, a web application offers the opportunity for continuous updates and reminders. This ensures that energy-saving habits become ingrained in the college community, creating lasting behavioral change over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, while other teams focus on specific technologies or systems, our web application provides the most effective and sustainable solution for promoting energy conservation across the college. Its accessibility, engagement features, and educational content ensure that it can make a real, lasting impact on the energy-saving habits of students and staff alike.
