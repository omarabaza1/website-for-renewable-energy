      <h2>What can AAST do to save energy (smart village )</h2>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>1. Check How Energy is Used </h3>
        <p>Look at how much energy the academy uses and find where it’s wasted.

            Use special tools (like smart electricity meters) to track energy use in real time.
            
            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>2. Use Better Lighting
        </h3>
        <p>Replace regular bulbs with LED bulbs that use less electricity.
<br>
            Install sensors or timers so lights turn off automatically when no one is in the room.
            
            
            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>3. Improve Air Conditioning and Heating</h3>
        <p>Make sure air conditioners and heaters are cleaned and working well.
            <br>
            Use smart temperature controls to avoid wasting energy when rooms are empty.
            <br>
            Open windows for fresh air instead of using air conditioners when it’s not too hot.
            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>4. Add Solar Panels</h3>
        <p>Use solar panels on buildings to make electricity from sunlight.
            <br>
            Solar energy can also heat water for bathrooms or kitchens.
            
            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>5. Use Energy-Saving Devices </h3>
        <p>Buy machines (like fridges, computers, and printers) that use less power.
            <br>
            Turn off computers and other devices when not in use or set them to sleep mode.
            
            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>6. Save Water and Energy Together </h3>
        <p>Install solar-powered water heaters.
            <br>
            Use taps and showers that use less water to save energy needed for pumping or heating water.
            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>7. Teach Everyone About Energy Saving</h3>
        <p>
            Explain to students and staff how they can save energy every day (like turning off lights and devices).
            <br>
            Run small events or posters to remind everyone to save energy.
            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>8. Use Green Building Ideas</h3>
        <p>
            When building or fixing campus buildings, use materials and designs that keep heat out in summer and in during winter.
            <br>
            Add things like insulation and better windows to reduce electricity for cooling or heating.
            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>9. Encourage Eco-Friendly Travel </h3>
        <p>Use bicycles or electric cars around the campus.
            <br>
            Set up a carpooling system for students and staff to share rides instead of driving alone.
            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>10. Smart Technology for Energy Control </h3>
        <p>Use apps or automatic systems to control lights, air conditioners, and other devices.
            <br>
            Let technology help predict when energy is needed and when it isn’t.
